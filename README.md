# Applications-of-Visualization-in-Data-Science
This repository contains the material delivered in "Applications of Data Visualization in Data Science" Course at University of  California Riverside

# Week 1: 
Fundamentals of Data Visualization
Python plotting tools
basic plotting with Matplotlib

# Week 2: 
seaborn package, a powerful tool based on Matplotlib that internally performs necessary statistical aggregation and mapping functions to create informative plots.

# Week 3:
In week 3 we introduced Bokeh, which is another Python plotting tool. In this session we created Scatter, line, Bar, Pie and Donut plots with Bokeh

# Week 4:
Object Oriented Programming: It is necessary to get familiar with Object Oriented Programming paradigm to get ready for future lectures in the class which is Computer graphics and rendering 3D models in python

# Week 5: 
Tableau!...

1. Please install Tableau software from here [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover)
2. Install and Activate Tableau
3. Download these two datasets from kaggle: [videogame 
sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) and

# Weak 6:
Tutorial on Blender: a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software tool set used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D-printed models, motion graphics, 
interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and, formerly, video games.
This week we explored the environment of the Blender software: 
1. how to define/move/rotate/scale/add/remove an objects
2. how to utilize different panels in Blender environment
3. What are the key components of a "Scene" in Blender

Please check this link [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and download Blender for free! Start working with Blender and explore its environments. We will be working with Blender in 
our future homework assignments...
